# tim-ferriss-search-engine

## Features

- Get a list of all Tim Ferriss podcast episode pages ([This page will help](https://tim.blog/2018/09/20/all-transcripts-from-the-tim-ferriss-show/))
- For each episode, record the title, date, show notes, and transcripts (Make a folder structure with date, then directory with title, then a text file for show notes and text file for transcripts)
- Make data available in an API
- Allow user to search all titles, show notes, and/or transcripts for specific topics

## Anticipated challenges

- Old transcripts are saved as Word documents rather than online

## Outline

- bulk load historical data
- create a system for grabbing newest data
- create a search engine


## Future projects with same data

- (This) Tim Ferriss Show search engine
- What would Tim say - host of Tim Ferriss show bot
- All mentioned books finder (& visualization, possible integration with Goodreads)
- Other EDA and visualizations (which episode was the longest, who's been on the most, what percent of the words are spoken by Tim vs guest, etc)
- Make a show where characters read the transcripts (would probably be better with real audio rather than robo-voice actors) (or moving lips on Tim & guests' heads lol)
- Twitter bot that retweets guest answers to rapid fire questions
